## Introduction

In this module, we explore the power of Neural Word Embeddings, leveraging the GloVe dataset for its remarkable accuracy in capturing linguistic nuances. This journey will illuminate the mechanisms by which models understand and process human language.

## Compatibility Notice

This version introduces `typing_extensions` for enhanced compatibility with Python versions prior to 3.10, diverging from the traditional `typing` module to ensure a smoother experience across different Python environments.

**Important**: If you've directly downloaded the files from GitHub, ensure that `short_glove.txt` is present and contains approximately 300MB of data to avoid any runtime issues.

## Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3.```bash
    streamlit run main.py
