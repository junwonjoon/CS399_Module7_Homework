CS399 Module 7: ai Exploring Neural Word Embeddings with Python
Author: Wonjoon Jun
Forked from Prof. Paulus at ERAU

This version uses typing_extensions to be more compatiable instead of typing use python versions prior to 3.10
If you have downloaded this file straight from github the code might not run. Check if short_glove.txt is actuall file with around 300MB of data.
To run the main.py you must pip install all of the requirements in requirements.txt. Then use following command: streamlit run main.py
If you want to view the z-score value of the words, view in the terminal, it will show you the logic behind, how the data is being processed.

Thank you! Enjoy!

P.S The GloVe dataset was chosen because this data set yielded most accurate results to me.
